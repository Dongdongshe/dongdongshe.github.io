I received my Ph.D. at the Department of Computer Science, <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> working with <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~suman/">Suman Jana</a> and <a href="https://www.rayb.info/">Baishakhi Ray</a>. Before coming to Columbia, I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhiyunq/">Zhiyun Qian</a> on Android Security at the <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/">University of California, Riverside</a>. I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree at <a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn/">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a>. 

I am broadly interested in **security** and **machine learning**. Particularly, I focus on applying data-driven approaches (e.g., large language models, machine learning, optimization) to solve security problems. Current research projects include:

* **Neural-Symbolic Software Testing:** advance the state-of-the-art in automated software testing techniques such as fuzzing, symbolic execution, and formal verification through developing algorithms and tools that combine neural and symbolic approaches.
* **Emerging Applications**: adopt data-driven approaches to solve security issues in high-impactful domains such as autonomous driving, ML system, and smart contracts.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
